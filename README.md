# The code for the hub
Main.lua contains all of the code necessary for running the hub.
Loadstring.lua contains the loadstring for running Main.lua, for most people we recommend using the loadstring.lua as it will always load the most updated code.

## WARNING: This hub will not work if your script executor does not support loadstrings.
